This project is under construction !!! I decided to refactor this project instead of creating a new one.

Mistakes I made before and planning to change now:
* made too little commits
* no unit tests
* not enough sperationo of concerns

What I am planning to change
- [] Refactor to Kotlin
- [] maybe migrate to Hilt instead of Dagger??
- [] Write unit test
- [] migrate to MVVM architecture
- [] use Bindings
- [] Better UI
- [] Animations??
- [] improve seperation of concerns 

What this app have right now:
* MVP architecture
* Dagger2
* Retrofit for API calls
*
