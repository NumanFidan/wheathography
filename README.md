This project is under construction !!! I decided to refactor this project instead of creating a new one.

Mistakes I made before and planning to change now:
* made too little commits
* no unit tests
* poor sperationo of concerns

What I am planning to change
- [x] Refactor to Kotlin
- [ ] maybe migrate to Hilt instead of Dagger??
- [ ] Write unit test
- [x] migrate to MVVM architecture
- [x] use Bindings
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Animations??
- [x] improve seperation of concerns 

What this app had before right now:
* MVVM architecture with LiveData
* Dagger2
* Retrofit for API calls
