## This project is under construction !!! I decided to refactor this project instead of creating a new one.

It is a simple weather app,
There is tree main screens:
* Add City screen, that user can add cities to the list
* City List screen, that user can see the list of added cities and their current temp
* City Detail screen, that user can see detail info about the current weather of the city

With this project, I mainly focused on delivering a working and well-written product in a limited time. It is a weekend project without a full-time commitment. Also refactored the project lately, refactoring was also done in a limited time and planning to refactor the project further, my ToDo list can be seen here


Mistakes I made before and planning to change:
* made too few commits
* no unit tests
* poor speration of concerns

What I am planning to change:
- [ ] Document the code
- [x] Refactor to Kotlin
- [ ] maybe migrate to Hilt instead of Dagger??
- [ ] JetPack ??
- [ ] Write unit test
- [x] migrate to MVVM architecture
- [x] use Bindings
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Animations??
- [x] improve seperation of concerns 

What this app has right now:
* MVVM architecture with LiveData
* Dagger2
* Retrofit for API calls

What this app had before:
* MVP architecture
* Dagger2
* Retrofit for API calls
*
